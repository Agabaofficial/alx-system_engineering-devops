 Web App Authentication Outage

Issue Summary:

Time it took place: November 8, 2023, 10:30 AM - November 9, 2023, 1:15 AM (UTC)
Impact: A snag in our user authentication service disrupted access for 30% of our users, rendering logins impossible.
Root Cause: An overlooked glitch hitched a ride with a recent code deployment, messing up our authentication mojo.
Timeline:

Detection: November 8, 2023, 10:30 AM (UTC)
How: Our alert system blared sirens as failed logins skyrocketed.
Actions Taken:
Dug into server logs and database queries.
Jumped on the "too much traffic" bandwagon initially.
Scoped out DDoS attacks and peeked into network oddities.
Misleading Paths:
Got sidetracked by a network glitch ghost from a recent security memo.
Threw a detective hat on code changes, thinking s the bug's hideout.
Escalation:
Hit up the DevOps and Security squads for a rescue mission.
Resolution:
Unmasked the villain - a rogue code commit.
Pulled a superhero move: rolled back to the previous stable version.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
The villain: a code deployment glitch making our authentication logic hiccup.
It caused the server to turn away good user credentials like a bouncer on a power trip.
Resolution:
Undo button pressed, reverted back to a safer version.
Called in the reinforcements: added automated tests for our authentication caper.
Beefed up our defenses: stricter code reviews before the big deploy.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements:
Beefed up monitoring for authentication shenanigans.
Armored our deployment pipeline with checks for common authentication pitfalls.
Scheduled regular patrols: security audits on our code turf.
Tasks:
Patched up Nginx, our virtual bouncer.
Set up more alarms: logged authentication failures for investigation.
Tightened the s training: incident response and debugging drills on the regular.

Final Thoughts on this issue;
This glitch hiccupped our services for a bit, but we snuffed it out. Lesson learned: keep a sharp eye on the code dance, and practice safe deployments. We're on the case, making sure our users can access their accounts hassle-free.crewthat
